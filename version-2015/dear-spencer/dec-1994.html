  <p>Dear Son,</p>
  <p>It was so great talking to you on the phone. Your voice was literally music to my ears. You sounded so good.</p>
  
  <p>I kept thinking about you throughout the day, wishing you could be with us, but feeling so good that you were where you were and doing what you are doing. I am so proud of you.</p>
  
  <p>I guess I am going to take the family and do the torch parade up at Alta this Saturday night. You and I had such a good time I thought I would try and make it a family tradition. I hope the others enjoy it as much as you and I did.</p>
  
  <p>We&rsquo;re going to stay up after and have a party in the day care center that my friends run. It ought to be fun.</p>
  
  <p>We&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of snow this year. But I haven&rsquo;t been skiing yet. It&lsquo;s just so expensive these days. I wish I could go every week. I would if I could. But for now I guess once or twice a
  year will have to do.</p>
  
  <p>Also, I think we&rsquo;re going to try the Moab Volley Ball Touney again this year. We&rsquo;ll miss you and Dougy (he leaves for his mission next month) but we&lsquo;ll give it a try and keep it going until you&lsquo;re all back from your missions. We&rsquo;ll probably use Brandon Dial and the two Wadsworth brothers this year.</p>
  
  <p>I wanted to continue teaching more about the priesthood this letter. I know there&rsquo;s a lot. I&rsquo;m glad you are rereading my letters over and over, you&rsquo;ll learn more by doing that.</p>
  
  <p>I&rsquo;ve taken a lot from the letters I wrote Jason but I have spent hours editing and expanding them for your letters, so now he&rsquo;s asking for copies of my letters to you to update his mission letter book. Maybe by the time I write Ryan&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll have it all down. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
  
  <p>I feel like what I am teaching you is really important and will prepare you for the greater things that are surely coming during your lives. As I have told you, I believe and hope that all five of my sons will be at Adam ondi Ahman for the great solemn assembly to begin final preparations of the earth for the Lords Grand Second Coming.</p>
  
  <p>Fulfilling a faithful honorable mission is an absolute requirement for each of you to be there. This is one of the reasons I&rsquo;m so pleased with what you are doing and the way I believe you are doing it.</p>
  
  <p>As you know we&rsquo;ve been talking about the four keys of the priesthood, what they are and what they mean.</p>
  
  <h1>How the priesthood administers the spiritual keys of power</h1>
  
  <p>Now let me explain how the priesthood administers each of the four spiritual keys of power to mankind.</p>
  
  <h2>Administering the first key of the Aaronic Priesthood; faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; the key of the ministering of angels</h2>
  
  <p>This first key is the most difficult for some people to see when it comes to understanding how the priesthood administers keys of
  salvation to mankind. When we speak of the key of faith we are talking about faith unto salvation. And the only faith that will save man is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and him crucified.</p>
  
  <h3>How does the Aaronic Priesthood administer faith?</h3>
  
  <p>Paul gives us the answer in the tenth chapter of Romans:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
  saved.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
  believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they
  have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
  And how shall they preach, except they be sent? As it is
  written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
  gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
  But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias [Greek
  for Isaiah] saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
  So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&rdquo; (Rom.1O:13-71)</p>
  
  <p>Joseph Smith commented on this subject using this very text:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;To say that the heathens would be damned because they did
  not believe the Gospel would be preposterous, and to say
  that the Jews would all be damned that do not believe in
  Jesus would be equally absurd; for &lsquo;how can they believe on
  him of whom they have not heard, and how can they hear
  without a preacher, and how can he preach except he be
  sent&rsquo; consequently neither Jew nor heathen can be culpable
  for rejecting the conflicting opinions of sectarianism, nor
  for rejecting any testimony but that which is send of God, for the preacher cannot preach except he be sent, so the hearer cannot believe without he hear a &lsquo;sent&rsquo; preacher, and  cannot be condemned for what he has not heard, and being without law, will have to be judged without law.&rdquo; (TPJS 221.)</p>
  
  <p>These teachings establish two absolutely key points regarding faith:</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">1. Faith comes by hearing &ldquo;the word of God&rdquo;.</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">2. The &ldquo;word of God&rdquo; is not just some words about God. The &ldquo;word of God&rdquo; is God&rsquo;s word which He sends to His children by the Holy Spirit through the true messengers that He authorized and sends by the authority of the priesthood.</p>
  
  <p>What needs to be understood is that NO ONE can have faith in Christ unto salvation unless they have heard this &ldquo;word of God&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the word of God&rdquo; can only be taught and heard in ONE TONGUE. This tongue is not Spanish, English, Hebrew, Greek, French or any other man made language. It is &ldquo;THE TONGUE OF ANGELS&rdquo; and this language:</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">1. Can only be spoken by the power of the Holy Ghost by those &ldquo;sent&rdquo; of God, and</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">2. It can only be heard and understood (interpreted) by those with &ldquo;broken hearts&rdquo; as the scriptures testify.</p>
  
  <p>Article of Faith #5 in the back of the Pearl of Great Price says &ldquo;We believe that a man MUST [not optional] be called of God by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are
  in authority [the priesthood], to preach the gospel ...&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Joseph said:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Faith comes by hearing the word of God, through the testimony of the servants of God; that testimony always tended by the spirit of prophecy and revelation.&rdquo; (TPJS 148.)</p>
  
  <p>Regarding this &ldquo;Tongue of Angels&rdquo; the scriptures say:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then ye can speak with the tongue of angels, ...&rdquo; (2Ne 31:13)</p>
  
  
  <p>&ldquo;Do ye not remember that I said unto you that AFTER ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with The tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost? Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost wherefore they speak the words of Christ [God].&rdquo; (2 Ne 32:2-3.)</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;...the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father&lsquo;s which sent me.&rdquo; (John l4:24)</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;When a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost, the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it UNTO THE HEARTS of the children of men. But behold, there are many that HARDEN THEIR HEARTS AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT, THAT IT HATH NO PLACE IN THEM...&rdquo; (2 Ne 32:1-2)</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;...the words that I speak unto you, are spirit; and they are life.&rdquo; (John 6:63)</p>
  
  <p>The word of God, spoken in the spiritual tongue of angels, heard [felt] only by the heart [spirit of man], is the only way men can have faith in Jesus Christ. Without that witness of the spirit THERE CAN BE NO FAITH IN THE HEARTS OF MEN.</p>
  
  <p>As emphasized, a key word in all of this is the word &ldquo;sent&rdquo; as set forth throughout the scriptures. ONLY &ldquo;SENT&rdquo; MESSENGERS CAN DECLARE THE WORD OF GOD WITH POWER AND AUTHORITY BY VIRTUE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. This all comes through the priesthood:</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">1. The priesthood performs the ordinance of the Laying on of Hands for The Gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">2. The priesthood authorizes and sends forth the messengers of salvation into the vineyard.</p>
  
  <p>Being SENT by the priesthood and EMPOWERED by the Gift of the Holy Ghost received through the priesthood, each of God&rsquo;s servants can speak as &ldquo;an angel...and go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people.&rdquo; (Alma 29:1)</p>
  
  <p>Those with broken hearts will HEAR [feel] the witness of the Holy Spirit, BELIEVE, and exercise FAITH in God&rsquo;s true messenger&rsquo;s testimonies. Those with hard hearts will NOT receive this witness, this testimony, this key, called FAITH.</p>
  
  <p>As the scriptures say &ldquo;FAITH comes by HEARING, and hearing by THE WORD OF GOD.&rdquo; (Rom. 10:17)</p>

  <h3>True Messengers</h3>
  
  <p>And so the priesthood administers FAITH, the first key of revealed religion, the first key of the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>
  
  <p>IT IS ONLY BY THIS FIRST KEY OF THE AARONIC PRIESTHOOD THAT MEN CAN KNOW GOD&rsquo;S TRUE MESSENGERS. How do we know that they are true messengers? By them giving us the First Key of the Aaronic Priesthood, the key of faith.</p>
  
  <p>Only as men speak by the tongue of angels, in other words, by the power of the Holy Ghost as &ldquo;sent messengers&rdquo; and that testimony is carried by the power of the spirit to the broken hearts of men, can they know that these are true messengers from the Father and begin to exercise the new key of FAITH given them, to know and say by the power of the testimony of the spirit that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
  
  <p>Note that ministering angels, true messengers, speaking with the tongue of angels, can be:</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">1. From either side of the veil. Mortals (such as our missionaries) or immortals (such as angels).</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">2. Also they can be females (such as our sister missionaries), sent by the priesthood, speaking by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">3. Also, their inspired witness can be in either spoken form or written form. The scriptures are a good example of the written form:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scriptures is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:2O-22.)</p>
  
  <p>From the title page of the Book of Mormon &ldquo;taken from the very last leaf, on the left hand side of the collection or book of plates, which contain the record&rdquo; (TPJS 7) we read that the Book of Mormon was &ldquo;written by way of commandment, AND ALSO BY THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY AND REVELATION.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>In other words, the Holy Ghost can bear witness with power to either the spoken or written form of the word &ldquo;sent forth&rdquo; by the servants of God to the children of men.</p>
  
  <p>In summery, we see that Faith really is the Key of the ministering of angels. Just as &ldquo;it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men;&rdquo; so it is-by faith that men receive true messengers &ldquo;wherefore, if these things have ceased to be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain&rdquo; (Moroni 7:37.) And always this faith comes by hearing the word of God &ldquo;sent&rdquo; by true messengers, like yourself Spencer, who cry repentance to the world.</p>
  
  <h2>Administering the Second Key of the Aaronic Priesthood; The Preparatory Gospel</h2>
  
  <p>Regarding the &ldquo;preparatory gospel&rdquo; Joseph Smith taught:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;There are certain key words and signs belonging to the priesthood which must be observed in order to obtain the blessing. The sign of Peter was to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins, with the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost; and in no other way is the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained.&rdquo; (TPJS l99.)</p>
  
  <p>This &ldquo;Sign of Peter&rdquo; that Joseph refers to here, &ldquo;the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins&rdquo; is the outward ordinance or &ldquo;sign&rdquo; that pertains to the second key of the Aaronic priesthood known as &ldquo;The Preparatory Gospel&rdquo; or, &ldquo;the Gospel of Repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins.&rdquo; (D&amp;C 13 84:26-27, 107:20.)</p>
  
  <p>Note that the outward act or ordinance of baptism, by itself, does not constitute the preparatory gospel, rather, baptism is the authorized, outwardly visible &ldquo;sign&rdquo; of the preparatory gospel. The preparatory gospel is more than the mere outward ordinance, it is man exercising the first key of the Aaronic priesthood &ldquo;faith&rsquo; unto repentance. (Alma 34:15-11.) It is man turning from sin to righteousness through the principle of repentance. It is man choosing to stop following Satan and the ways of the sinful world and start exercising faith and following his new master, Christ the Lord, walking the strait and narrow path of his righteousness or in other words, keeping the commandments, which commitment man &ldquo;signifies&rdquo; outwardly, for all to see, by the ordinance of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins.</p>
  
  <p>The &ldquo;key&rdquo; is the GOSPEL of repentance, with<br>
  the &ldquo;sign&rdquo; of the BAPTISM of repentance.</p>
  
  <p>The Preparatory Gospel is called a Key of the Aaronic Priesthood for the simple reason that it is administered by the Aaronic Priesthood. It is by virtue of the Aaronic Priesthood that the &ldquo;word of God&rdquo; is sent forth to men on earth. Those in authority, by virtue of the presiding keys of authority set apart and send missionaries into the world to &ldquo;prepare&rdquo; God&rsquo;s children for the spiritual rebirth that can only come to them through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ unto repentance. These true messengers sent by the priesthood &ldquo;prepare the way&rdquo; and make men&rsquo;s paths strait by preaching the preparatory gospel of repentance. Only when men repent and turn from sin to righteousness and honestly signify it by entering into the waters of the baptismal covenant are they prepared and ready for the next key.</p>
  
  <p>It is by the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood, that men are authorized to perform the important &ldquo;Sign of Peter&rdquo; or ordinance of baptism under the proper supervision of their presiding ecclesiastical leaders.</p>
  
  <p>While only the priesthood has the authority to ADMINISTER this key, or administer this gospel with it&lsquo;s sign or ordinance, yet it is administered to all interested, worthy individuals, male and female, who have reached the age of eight (the age of accountability) none of whom yet have the priesthood. People do not need to hold the priesthood to RECEIVE this priesthood key. In fact, nobody holds the priesthood at the time that the priesthood administers this second key of the Aaronic Priesthood to them. ALL may enjoy the benefits of the Baptism of Repentance for the remission of sins as soon as they have reached the age of accountability.</p>
  
  <p>It is important to note here that the preparatory gospel, the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, can appropriately be summed up in a single word: &ldquo;RIGHTEOUSNESS&rdquo;.</p>
  
  <p>This becomes clearly apparent by examining the principle of repentance and the ordinance of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. Repentance and baptism are about SIN. When we repent, we repent of sin, meaning &mdash; we stop sinning.</p>
  
  <p>As Ezkeiel says, the repentant person will &ldquo;TURN FROM ALL HIS SINS that he hath committed and KEEP ALL [GOD&lsquo;S] STATUTES and DO THAT WHICH IS LAWFUL AND RIGHT...&rdquo; And because of this repentance, Ezekiel promises &ldquo;All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him; IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS which he hath done he shall live.&rdquo; (Ezk. 18:21-22 see also v30-32.)</p>
  
  <p>Clearly, repentance is about nothing more or less than RIGHTEOUSNESS, turning from sin to RIGHTEOUSNESS.</p>
  
  <p>And so it is with the sign or ordinance of Baptism by Immersion for the Remission of Sins. In this priesthood ordinance the recipient is cleansed from UNRIGHTEOUSNESS and enters into a
  covenant to KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;...therefore come and be baptized unto repentance that ye may be...cleanse[d] from all UNRIGHTEOUSNESS...and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with [God] to KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS, and witness it [signify it] unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.&rdquo; (Alma 7:14-l5, see also Mosiah 18:10)</p>
  
  <p>Clearly the preparatory gospel, the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, is about nothing more or less than man turning to RIGHTEOUSNESS. Is there any other state that heaven will ultimately sanction? None. No unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of God or, in other words, into the presence of God. Nothing short of man turning to righteousness prepares him for the companionship of holy beings.</p>
  
  <p>In this important sense the second key of the Aaronic priesthood may properly be referred to simply as RIGHTEOUSNESS.</p>
  
  <p>So we may say that the Second Key of the Aaronic Priesthood is:</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">1. The Gospel of repentance, and baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. (See D&amp;C 13.) Or,</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">2. The Preparatory Gospel. (See D&amp;C 84:26-27.) Or,</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">3. The baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. (See D&amp;C 107:20.) Or,</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">4. Righteousness. (See Ezekiel 18:21-22.)</p>
  
  <p>And clearly, this Second Key of the Priesthood only comes to man through the administrations of the Aaronic Priesthood as God&rsquo;s messengers call the world to repentance by the preaching of the word of God and Baptize them by immersion for the remission of sins.</p>
  
  <h2>Administering the first key of the Melchizedek Priesthood; the Gift of the Holy Ghost</h2>
  
  <p>Joseph Smith taught:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the Gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius (Acts10) received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man, and it obey him;&rdquo; (TPJS l99.)</p>
  
  <p>Whether we are male, female or children who have reached the age of accountability, we can all receive the First Key of the Melchizedek Priesthood. And we all get the First Key of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the Gift of the Holy Ghost or First Comforter, through the priesthood (the Melchizedek Priesthood) by the Melchizedek Priesthood sign or ordinance of the Laying on of Hands for the Gift of The Holy Ghost. That is why this is a key of the priesthood, specifically the Melchizedek Priesthood. It comes only through this priesthood, but we do not have to have the priesthood to receive it. In fact no one ever holds the priesthood at the time they receive the sign or ordinance of this key. After we have received this key, whether we subsequently receive priesthood authority or not, we may enjoy the benefits of the Gift of the Holy Ghost in our personal lives. We do not need to hold the priesthood to enjoy the powers of this wonderful key of the priesthood. We only need to receive it&rsquo;s authorized sign from the Melchizedek Priesthood by receiving the ordinance of the laying on of Hands for The Gift of The Holy Ghost. Then it is up to us as to whether we ever use the key or, in other words, enjoy the powers of the Holy Spirit in our personal lives.</p>
  
  <p>What are the benefits of the Gift of the Holy Ghost? The benefits fall into two general categories: The fruits of the spirit and the gifts of the spirit. Let&rsquo;s look at each.</p>
  
  <h3>The Fruits (goodness) of the Spirit</h3>
  
  <p>The fruits of the spirit are listed in bulk in several places in the scriptures. The fruits of the spirit are the attributes of God&rsquo;s goodness. For instance in Galatians 5:22 we read that the fruits of the spirit are </p>
  
  <p>love<br>
  joy<br>
  peace<br>
  long-suffering<br>
  meekness<br>
  kindness<br>
  etc.</p>
  
  <p>Similar lists (no single list is complete because it&lsquo;s so long) are found in many other places, like D&amp;C 107:30-31 for instance. The properties of the increased spirit (Mtlsig) that the Holy Ghost gives to mankind, cause, inspire, instill or further magnify and influence these feelings, and therefore thoughts, words and actions, in our lives. </p>
  
  <p>This wonderful list of godly attributes is called &ldquo;the Divine Nature&rdquo; by Peter. (2 Pet. 1 1-10.) These are the attributes of our Heavenly Father&lsquo;s nature because he is filled with this power we call holy spirit (Mtlsig), and it empowers Him to feel, think, speak and act in these divine ways. These are the properties Mtlsig instills in living organisms whether pre-mortal, mortal or post-mortal.</p>
  
  <p>It is not the Priesthood keys of authority that empower mankind to be like (to know) God, but rather the Priesthood keys power, (faith, righteousness and the Holy Spirit) that enable them to access the greater divine nature of Mtlsig that constitutes the goodness of God. But, it is only through the authority of the priesthood that the keys of these powers come to mankind.</p>
  
  <p>In other words, I am not imbued and empowered with love, patience and kindness because I hold priesthood authority. If I enjoy a measure of these divine attributes it is because of the Holy Spirit (Mtlsig) that is within me. But I got The gift of the Holy Ghost who endows me with greater degrees of Mtlsig and it&lsquo;s wonderful properties from the priesthood. Specifically the Melchizedek Priesthood, by the priesthood ordinance of the laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
  
  <p>Remember, Joseph taught that we can be blessed by the Holy Ghost before baptism with the lesser degrees of these sanctifying virtues but that only by the Gift of the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands can we have access to the greater portions or degrees of these divine virtues. What gives us access to the greater portions of the divine spirit is the key called the Gift of the Holy Ghost, the First Comforter, the First Key of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the first key the Melchizedek Priesthood gives to those who exercise greater faith and receive the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, thereby cleansing their temples through the blood of Christ, so that the Holy Ghost might constantly dwell therein and grant greater gifts, endowments or portions of this glorious Mtlsig to the children of men. This is how God&lsquo;s children come to him, become like him or in other words know him, by becoming one with Him in the Mtlsig.</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes members of the Church wonder how there can be good and loving people in the world without the Gospel &mdash; Without God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit and so forth. The answer is quite simple &mdash; they can&rsquo;t. All good comes only from God. (Mori. 7:12, Alma 5:40.) You see, they do have the gospel, just not the fullness of the gospel. Good people in the world without the fullness of the gospel are growing in these fruits by exercising faith in the spirit or light of Christ that is given to every man that cometh into the world. (D&amp;C 84: 45-46, Mori. 7:15-16.) They exercise their faith in the promptings of their conscience unto repentance and righteousness and grow in the spirit of Christ&rsquo;s light.</p>
  
  <p>This has been happening in every age and place since the world began whether they knew about Christ or not. With or without the fullness of the gospel there has always been the first portions of the gospel active in the live of God&rsquo;s children. The &ldquo;fullness of the Gospel&rdquo; on the other hand, is a greater revelation and a greater endowment of God&rsquo;s spirit calculated to prepare men to come back into God&rsquo;s presence. Man must grow in spirit by degrees, and the more light one is given the more is expected and required of him. He who sins against the greater light receives the greater condemnation. (D&amp;C.82:3.)</p>
  
  <p>As we preach the gospel we are taking the greater revelation and endowment of light restored from heaven to the world. But whether they ever have the opportunity to hear the gospel in this life or not, the gospel is happening in their lives &mdash; always. The spirit or light of Christ is calling them to righteousness. If they exercise FAITH in the word of God to their hearts they will REPENT AND WALK IN RIGHTEOUSNESS (according to the light they have been given) and because they continually turn to greater righteousness they grow in light or spirit. Their views become clearer and clearer as to what brings true happiness and peace and what does not. They grow in light and truth, in the fruits of the spirit and God loves them.</p>
  
  <p>Most of the billions of mortals who have, are and will inhabit this planet never get the fullness of the gospel revealed to them. They never even get the middle portions of Christianity in general. But they experience the mission of mortality just the same and will be judged according to their faith and righteousness as they respond to the voice of The Savior within them during their lives. In other words, the gospel is happening in their lives whether they realize it or not. It has just not all been revealed to them.</p>
  
  <p>If they have been humble and honest they have heard the voice tell them that they are creations of God whether they have ever heard any formal religion or not. Christianity will reveal to them more about their creator and reveal the Savior, Christ the Lord to them, if they will accept it. The restored Gospel is the fullness of the Gospel given to men in general on earth. By it&rsquo;s revelation man can come to know God in the most complete sense possible on earth.</p>
  
  <p>Only this fullness of the gospel can prepare men and the earth so that they will not be consumed by the coming glory. The lesser portions or revelations of the gospel are insufficient to bring men and the planet to the sanctified state necessary to withstand the glory about to be revealed when the earth is transfigured to it&rsquo;s prophesied millennial glory.</p>
  
  <p>This is what you are doing Spencer. You are taking the fullness of the gospel to the world in preparation for the coming glory.</p>
  
  <h3>The Gifts (power) of the Spirit</h3>
  
  <p>The Gifts of the Spirit are the Powers of God (not to be confused with the goodness of God) vouchsafed to man on earth through the medium of the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
  
  <p>Some in the church have mistakenly believed that there were two powers in the church, the power of the priesthood and the power of the spirit, when there has never been but one. Just as the scriptures teach that there is only one faith, one God and one baptism, so it should become apparent to those who search the scriptures, that there is but one power. The only power there is in the church is the power of the spirit. THERE IS NO OTHER POWER.</p>
  
  <p>As we have stated, although the English language sometimes uses the two terms &ldquo;power&rdquo; and &ldquo;authority&rdquo; interchangeably or synonymously, the two terms are not true synonyms. Technically, especially in the gospel context, authority and power are different things. It is very important to understand that the spiritual keys of power and the presiding keys of authority are not the same things.</p>
  
  <p>Authority is the RIGHT to control or handle the power, but it is not the power itself. In other words, the authority administers the power that flows through the priesthood to the children of the kingdom. Because this power (the power of the spirit) is ALWAYS administered by the authority of the priesthood, it is sometimes called the power of the priesthood. But, as we have seen, the priesthood administers the power of the spirit, by the laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost, to those not holding the authority of the priesthood (women, children eight and older, and unordained men) never to ordained men.</p>
  
  <p>Men first get the power of the priesthood or First Key of the Melchizedek Priesthood by the laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost. Then later men may receive the ordinations that give them the authority of the priesthood.</p>
  
  <p>Because the power of the spirit is sometimes called the power of the priesthood some in the church have mistakenly understood that only those holding the priesthood have access to the gifts of the spirit. This, of course, is not true. There are incidents all through the scriptures, and more to the point, our dispensation, of non-priesthood holders enjoying the gifts of the spirit, or in other words, the powers of the spirit.</p>
  
  <p>Many with no priesthood authority (they do not hold the keys of authority) do enjoy the keys of power. They enjoy this power in the priesthood, meaning the powers of the spirit by virtue of the keys of power (faith, righteousness, Gift of the Holy Ghost) that the priesthood gave them.</p>
  
  <p>Think of Miriam, Deborah and Anna prophesying (a gift or power of the spirit) in the Old and New Testament. For that matter, think of Lucy Smith, Lydia Knight or Eliza R. Snow prophesying in our dispensation. They did not hold the keys of authority but they did enjoy the power that is in the priesthood, known as the Holy Spirit (Mtlsig), the power that they obtained from the keys of the priesthood (faith, repentance, the Gift of the Holy Ghost etc.)</p>
  
  <p>The gifts of the spirit are listed in three major passages in the scriptures: Moroni 10, D&amp;C46 and 1 Cor 12-14 The list includes but is not limited to:</p>
  
  <p>Prophecy<br>
  Healing<br>
  Being healed<br>
  Speaking in tongues<br>
  Interpreting tongues<br>
  Working Miracles<br>
  Knowledge (teaching with power)<br>
  Discerning Spirits<br>
  etc.</p>
  
  <p>It is significant that priesthood authority is never even mentioned in any of these passages. Why is this? For the simple reason that when we talk about the gifts of the spirit we are talking about the INCLUSIVE spiritual keys of power, NOT THE EXCLUSIVE PRESIDING KEYS OF AUTHORITY.</p>
  
  <p>All confirmed members of the church have right to the gifts of the spirit in their personal lives, male or female, young or old by virtue of the Gift of the Holy Ghost given them by the Melchizedek Priesthood and in accordance with their own personal faith and righteousness.</p>
  
  <p>For example, in an exegesis on Mark 16 Joseph said:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;No matter who believes, these signs such as healing the sick, casting out devils, etc.; should follow all that believe, whether male or female.&rdquo; (TPJS 224.)</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Respecting females administering for the healing of the sick, he further remarked, there could be no evil in it, if God gave his sanction by healing; that there could be no more sin in any female laying hands on and praying for the sick (same language as for elders in James 5) than in wetting the face with water; It is no sin for anybody to administer that has faith [First Key], or if the sick have faith, to be healed by their administration. (TPJS 224-5.)</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;President Smith then gave instruction respecting the propriety of females administering to the sick by the prayer of faith, the laying on of hands, or the anointing with oil; and said it was according to revelation that the sick should be nursed with herbs and mild food, and not by the hand of an enemy. Who are more better qualified to administer than our faithful and zealous sisters, whose hearts are full of faith, tenderness, sympathy and compassion. No one.&rdquo; (TPJS 229.)</p>
  
  <p>However, when it comes to authoritatively discerning those gifts among the membership of the church, whether they be of God, and presiding over how the body of the saints interact with each other within the church, with these gifts, then we are talking about authority. The presiding keys of authority direct the order of the church. God&rsquo;s house is a house of order. Not a house of confusion. Just because we all have right to the gifts doesn&lsquo;t give us the authority to run around prophesying and teaching and healing with no order, rhyme or reason. That is not the way of God&lsquo;s kingdom. God&lsquo;s house is a house of order.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, outside of the use of these gifts of the spirit for our own personal blessing and benefit, we must look to the order of the church when these gifts are utilized in any other capacity.</p>
  
  <p>One major dichotomy of duty that has been made clear by the prophets over the years pertains to the roles of fathers and mothers within the kingdom of God and the order of the priesthood. It has been made abundantly clear that the home is the most important priority of the Saints. There are NO qualifiers, no strings. NO SUCCESS will ever compensate for failure in the homes of the Latter-day Saints. The MOST IMPORTANT WORK we will ever do will be within the four walls of our own homes.</p>
  
  <p>In the light of this revealed truth, the prophets have reaffirmed, over and over again, the traditional roles set down by God from the very beginning, from the creation of Adam and Eve. Men are to look to the duties and necessities outside the home in a way that allows mothers to stay in the home and nurture the all-important family. In other words, it makes no sense for both mother and father to run off earning incomes, serving missions, administering the affairs of the church, healing the sick and saving the world, while their family goes to hell. And this, for a very obvious reason. If the basic unit fails the greater units will too. nothing will change that simple equation.</p>
  
  <p>As President Kimball said:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;..when the home is destroyed, the nation goes to pieces. There can be no question about this, and all historians or those who have followed a historical line of thought have come to that same conclusion.&rdquo; (Gen. Conf. Apr. l978.)</p>
  
  <p>This being the obvious case, we see why the prophets have been so their counsel to modern Israel that mothers stay home their families. This grand priority of the saints must never be mistaken as simply one of many equal options or seen as a part time assignment. And we further see that women of God are not only free to enjoy and utilize but indeed must exercise the fruits and gifts of God in their personal lives. The salvation of their homes depends upon it. Their children need the fruits and gifts of the Holy Spirit active in the lives of their mothers in order that they may be brought up in the admonition of the Lord.</p>
  
  <p>But this is speaking of the home. In the church, God has set up an order, an order that children, mothers, fathers, quorum presidents, bishops, stake presidents, regional representatives and general authorities must respect and never overstep.</p>
  
  <p>Spiritual power does not give us authority any more than authority gives us spiritual power. These are separate and distinct sets of priesthood keys. We must learn the priesthood.</p>
  
  <p>We must always act within the bounds the Lord sets. Enjoying certain spiritual gifts in no way gives me right to step outside the bounds of my authorized role and calling within the kingdom. To do so would only create confusion and contention. The scriptures are clear that confusion and contention are not of God but of the adversary (3 Ne. 11:29 &amp; D&amp;C 132:8.)</p>
  
  <p>Each of us must learn our duty to act within the offices and roles to which we are called. Within those offices and calling the Lord wants us, expects us, to humbly use the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit to righteously fulfill our stewardships and bring about great things upon the earth. He pleads with us to exercise great faith and humility &mdash; to both walk by his spirit through personal revelation and, at the same time, to humbly sustain and follow his anointed at all levels of the kingdom as they do the same within the scopes of their stewardships. Those who love the truth will see that there is no contradiction between the two.</p>
  
  <p>As members we need not feel belittled or intimidated that we are asked to sustain and follow others, to submit and yield to those called and anointed of the Lord to lead us in various ways. And as priesthood leaders we need not somehow feel concerned or threatened by the saints at large enjoying the spiritual keys of the priesthood in their personal lives and individual callings. All of this is according to the order of heaven that God has restored.</p>
  
  <p>We may ALL enjoy the First Key of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the First Comforter, with it&rsquo;s wonderful spiritual endowments of goodness and power, which key is only administered to the children of men by the Melchizedek Priesthood &mdash; But always with wisdom and order staying within the bounds which the Lord has set.</p>
  
  <h3>The Goodness &ldquo;Fruits&rdquo; and the Power &ldquo;Gifts&rdquo;</h3>
  
  <p>I want you to note, son, that both the fruits and the gifts are equally important in each of our lives. To have either without the other is not sufficient. Let me demonstrate what I am saying this way:</p>
  
  <p>If you were given the hypothetical choice of having either a good god or a powerful god to rule over you, but not both, which would you choose?</p>
  
  <p>If you chose to have a good god, you loose. He has no power. He cannot bless you, heal you, protect you or save you.</p>
  
  <p>If you chose to have a powerful god, you loose. There is not a more terrifying thought than that of an all-powerful god ruling over us who has no goodness.</p>
  
  <p>As you can see we want our God to be both. We need our God to have the goodness and the power. And so it is with us. We are God&rsquo;s children, created in his image, male and female. His plan and desire, just as any goodly parent, is for His children to grow to become like Him. For you to become only good or only powerful will never make you like him. You need to develop and grow in both the fruits and the gifts of the spirit. Only then will you become like him. It is important that you seek to grow both in the goodness of God and in the power of God and allow every other child of God the same opportunity, male or female.</p>
  
  <h2>Administering the Second Key of the Melchizedek Priesthood; the Second Comforter and the ordinances and promises that pertain thereto</h2>
  
  <p>I am not going to tell you much about this one until we can talk personally after your mission. This is the most sacred key and pertains to the &ldquo;greater things&rdquo; that are &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; from and &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; for men to speak of promiscuously. But I will tell you this much for now, and you keep it to yourself &mdash; the formal promise of the Second Comforter only comes AFTER a man has his &ldquo;Calling and Election made Sure&rdquo; by receiving &ldquo;The More Sure Word of Prophecy&rdquo; through the priesthood. The key word I just used was &ldquo;AFTER&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;When the Lord has thoroughly proved him, and finds that the man is determined to serve Him at all hazards, then the man will find his calling and election made sure, THEN (in other words Spencer, AFTER this) it will be his privilege to receive the other Comforter which the Lord hath promised the Saints, as is recorded in the testimony of John 14...&rdquo; (TPJS l5O.)</p>
  
  <p>The man must first receive The More Sure Word of Prophecy ADMINISTERED BY THE PRIESTHOOD. This will become clearer to you when you come home and we talk personally.</p>
  
  <p>For now what I want you to see is that every one of these four keys is administered through the Priesthood. Faith is administered through the priesthood, the Preparatory Gospel is administered through the priesthood, The Gift of The Holy Ghost is administered through the priesthood and even the Second Comforter is administered through the priesthood.</p>
  
  <h3>Coming into the presence of God</h3>
  
  <p>The whole of the gospel is designed to accomplish one thing &mdash; to bring man back into the presence of God lost by transgression. He wants to be back in fellowship with God.</p>
  
  <p>But now that man has obtained the knowledge of the gods for himself by experiencing the vicissitudes of mortality , he wants to come into FULL fellowship with the gods. To literally become one with the Eloheim (the Gods) who rule and reign in eternity.</p>
  
  <p>How does fallen man do this? By the keys of the priesthood.</p>
  
  <p>Before we discuss how man comes into the presence of God by utilizing the four keys of the priesthood we must first understand what the presence of God is. What does it mean to dwell in God&lsquo;s presence?</p>
  
  <p>When most people think of being in the presence of God or going back into the presence of God or dwelling with God they think of it in sort of a Kindergarten way. They think we are all going to go back and live in his house, or his neighborhood or his community or on his planet. Well, obviously that&rsquo;s not going to work. He would have to have an awfully big house or neighborhood or planet to house billions of children from worlds without end. Besides we are told that our Celestial Kingdom will be right here on this planet when the earth is glorified. (D&amp;C 88:17-26, 130:9, ect.) We&lsquo;re going to stay right here. But &ldquo;this earth is going to be rolled back into the presence of God, and crowned with celestial glory.&rdquo; (TPJS l8l.)</p>
  
  <p>So what does it mean to be in God&lsquo;s presence. This question is key to understanding the gospel. If we are not going to all be living in God&lsquo;s living room how are we all going to be in his presence? The answer is simple. To be &ldquo;in God&lsquo;s presence&rdquo; means to be &ldquo;in the spirit&rdquo; - His spirit. Remember Mtlsg. This is the glory of God. He is not just another resurrected being. He is a God. In other words, He is a glorified resurrected being filled with a fullness of light and truth (Mtlsg.) This, among other things, is what makes him God. Many other resurrected beings are only filled with portions of glory and are Telestial or terrestrial instead of being exalted to the &ldquo;highest degree of light&rdquo; i.e. glory.</p>
  
  <p>God is a resurrected being of flesh and bone, his body can only be in one place at one time. But like a magnet, that also can only be in one place at one time, has a magnetic field that is filled with and influenced by the presence of it&lsquo;s electro-magnetic force, so God&lsquo;s entire kingdom is filled with the power or light (seen or unseen) of his Mtlsg. (D&amp;C 88:12.) This glory that proceeds forth from his presence is as much a part of him as his hand or foot is. When his Mtlsg is with us he is with us.</p>
  
  <p>So the words &ldquo;presence of God&rdquo; and &ldquo;glory of God&rdquo; are used interchangeably like in D&amp;C 88:19. A good way to explain God&lsquo;s presence is found in D&amp;C 109:12. Section 109 is the dedicatory prayer given in the Kirkland Temple. Notice the introduction, Joseph said it was given by revelation. Notice that in verse 1 he prays that God&lsquo;s &ldquo;Glory&rdquo; may rest down upon the house that God&lsquo;s &ldquo;holy presence may be CONTINUALLY in this house&rdquo;. Obviously this is not meant to mean that God&lsquo;s resurrected body is going to come down and sit continually in the temple. He&rsquo;s a busy man with things to do besides continually sit in one little building on one little planet. Clearly it&lsquo;s the presence of his Glory that is being referred to. So now we understand a little more about the presence of God being the Glory of God.</p>
  
  <h3>Degrees of Glory</h3>
  
  <p>Most Latter-Day Saints have heard and used the phrase &ldquo;degrees of glory&rdquo; as you know. But few have really even begun to understand the scope and magnitude of ramifications connected with this phrase.</p>
  
  <p>Degrees of glory are degrees of God, Spencer. The greater degree of Glory you obtain, the greater portion of God&rsquo;s presence you are in. On the other hand the lesser degree of glory you enjoy, the lesser degree of God&rsquo;s presence you experience.</p>
  
  <p>What degree of God&rsquo;s presence do you wish to obtain? A Telestial portion? A Terrestrial portion? A Celestial portion? Or, a full portion, known as exaltation?</p>
  
  <p>Here in mortality, in the fallen condition, man has lost the presence, or in other words, the spirit of God. He has virtually no fellowship with God. He is spiritually dead and must be born of the spirit again.</p>
  
  <p>Telestial beings enjoy the first portion of God&rsquo;s presence having access to the light of the Holy Ghost, the First Comforter and least of the members of the Godhead. (D&amp;C 76:81-86.)</p>
  
  <p>Terrestrial beings enjoy a greater degree of God&rsquo;s presence having access to the blessings of the Second Comforter, even Jesus Christ, the second member of the Godhead. (D&amp;C 76: 71-77.)</p>
  
  <p>Celestial beings enjoy even a greater degree of God&rsquo;s presence enjoying the Glory of the Father, the Head God. (D&amp;C 76:54-62.) Those who have obtained the highest degree of this kingdom (D&amp;C 131:1-4) enjoy even a fullness of Godhood. They have full fellowship with the god&lsquo;s being like them and one with them in all things.</p>
  
  <h3>A degree at a time</h3>
  
  <p>Fallen man cannot come into the full presence of God all at once. He would be consumed by God&rsquo;s glory.  Remember, &ldquo;Our God is a consuming fire&rdquo; (TPJS 367, Hebrews 1229.) He lives in everlasting burnings, in a perfect society and state where no imperfect and corruptible thing can come, let alone dwell.</p>
  
  <p>As Joseph said &ldquo;this is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment.&rdquo; (TPJS 51.) </p>
  
  <p>Man must come into the glorious presence of God by degrees, beginning at the first and so on to the fullness. He must learn line upon line and grow precept upon precept.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;The Lord deals with this people as a tender parent with a child, communicating light and intelligence and the knowledge of his ways as they can bear it.&rdquo; (TPJS 305.)</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;It is not wisdom that we should have all knowledge at once presented before us; but that we should have a little at a time; then we can comprehend it.&rdquo; (TPJS 297.)</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot keep all the commandments without first knowing them, and we cannot expect to know all, or more than we now know unless we comply with or keep those we have already received.&rdquo; (TPJS 256.)</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Behold, ye are little children and ye cannot bear all things now; ye must grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; (D&amp;C 50:40)</p>
  
  <p>People usually equate the word grace only with the word love. But love is a fruit of the spirit (Gal. 5:22) a property of Mtlsig, and to fully understand what it means to grow in grace we must understand that grace is yet another term that may be used synonymously with Mtlsig. Read D&amp;C 93:11-40 carefully and you will come to see that grace clearly equates to truth, light, spirit, intelligence and glory.</p>
  
  <p>To grow in grace by degrees is to grow in glory by degrees as so beautifully laid out in D&amp;C 93. And to grow in glory by degrees is to grow in godliness. It is to come into fellowship with God. It is to COME to God by becoming like God, by becoming one with God, by being filled with the presence/glory of God.</p>
  
  <h3>The Keys of the Priesthood and True Prayer</h3>
  
  <p>Now I want you to see how the keys work together, Let&rsquo;s talk about the principle of prayer as it relates the four keys and to coming into fellowship with God. As we do so, keep the temple endowment in mind.</p>
  
  <p>As you know, mortal man&rsquo;s relationship with God is spiritual. We cannot see him with our eyes, hear him with our ears, touch him with our hands, smell him with our noses or taste him with our tongues &mdash; right now. Mortal man can&rsquo;t comprehend God by the five senses.</p>
  
  <p>As Paul said &ldquo;Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which the Lord hath prepared for them that love him. But he hath revealed them unto us by the spirit...the things of God are spiritually discerned.&rdquo; (1 Cor 2:9-14.)</p>
  
  <p>Since man is out of God&rsquo;s presence, our relationship or &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; with God is strictly spiritual for now. Our only means of &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; with him is prayer and revelation by the power of the spirit. As man seeks to come into greater fellowship with God through prayer and revelation he does so gradually, line upon line.</p>
  
  <p>There is an &ldquo;order&rdquo; to prayer. True prayer is different than prayer. True prayer receives answers. Turn to D&amp;C 124 and read verse 95 and verse 97. Joseph was commanded to show Hyrum and William keys whereby they could ask and receive. What are the KEYS whereby men may ask and receive?</p>
  
  <p>Now turn to TPJS 226 and read the first paragraph. Joseph spoke of delivering the keys of the priesthood to the Church (in the temple that was being built) so the faithful members might know how to ask the lord and receive an answer.</p>
  
  <p>The four keys of the priesthood are the keys to asking and receiving an answer Spencer. They are the four keys of true prayer. And they are in a very specific order.</p>
  
  <p>The first key to true prayer is to ask in faith. (James 1:5-6.) There are a hundred scriptures to this effect. This is the first key of prayer. Your contacts don&lsquo;t need to turn any of the other keys to get an answer to prayer. They don&rsquo;t need to repent and stop smoking and drinking or get baptized or confirmed. All they have to do to get an answer is turn the first key of prayer which is the first key of the priesthood and ask in faith. If they will sincerely ask with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth unto them. (Moro. 10:4-5.) That&rsquo;s all they have to do. When the lord answers, your contacts will know that you are &ldquo;true messengers.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit will carry your witness and his witness to the heart of your contacts with power and they will know &mdash; but only if they turn this first key and ask in faith. They will have taken the first step of spiritual fellowship with God.</p>
  
  <p>Now that they have the witness. They have two choices:</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">1. They can reject it. (This can happen immediately or later on.)</p>
  
  <p class="numbered">2. Or they can receive it and take the next step of fellowship by turning the next key of exercising their faith unto repentance, start living more righteously, enter the waters of baptism and make a covenant with God to keep his commandments.</p>
  
  <p>Now, through this &ldquo;preparatory gospel,&rdquo; through turning from sin to &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; by seeking to keep the commandments, they have greater fellowship with God, more favor with him, and greater power in their prayers. (Read each of these now in this order: 1 Jn 3:22, 1 Pet 3:12, 1Ne 17:35 first 3 lines, Mosi 10:13) This is the second key of true prayer! The Lord favors the righteous for he HEARS their prayers and ANSWERS them. This is the second key to asking and receiving an answer.</p>
  
  <p>Now that they are growing in faith and righteousness and in fellowship with God we see the third key coming more and more into the picture. Read D&amp;C 46:28 &amp; 30. The third key of the priesthood is The Holy Spirit and the third key of Prayer is to pray or ask in spirit. He that asketh in the spirit asketh according to the will of God. You see Spencer, as a man grows in faith he will live more righteously because true faith always produces fruit &mdash; works &mdash; righteousness. (We&rsquo;ve talked about that) As a man grows in righteousness he is worthy to receive more of the spirit (more light and truth). Just as the spirit will not dwell in an unholy temple (Hel 4:34, Alma 34:36) so the spirit will grow and increase in a temple becoming more and more righteous and worthy. (D&amp;C 50:24) But this is a gradual process as I indicated earlier. (D&amp;C 50:40.)</p>
  
  <p>As we grow in spirit our prayers are influenced more and more by its light that is expanding within us. We grow in the knowledge of God, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true (Mosi 4:l2) and our thoughts and requests to God become more and more in harmony with His holy mind and will.</p>
  
  <p>I have been guided in my prayers many times. I have asked in the spirit on numerous occasions &mdash; they are always answered. Sometimes I haven&rsquo;t known I was asking in the spirit when I actually was and I only came to realize it later. I had many such prayers on my mission. Other times I know I am asking in the spirit even as I ask. Asking in the spirit is the third key as we grow in our fellowship with God.</p>
  
  <p>As a man perceivers, growing spiritually in light and truth, he will eventually reach the point where he obtains the fourth key. As part of obtaining the fourth key he receives a very specific promise of the Lord:</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;...and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto the according to their words, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.&rdquo; (Hel. 10:5.)</p>
  
  <p>This is the fourth and Grand key of prayer wherein the Lord promises that what ever is asked will be granted because He knows the man has reached a spiritual status where he will never ask that which is contrary to his will.</p>
  
  <p>It is beautiful and powerful to see how each key in the order grows into the next. It has been wonderful to experience them for myself in my personal life and feel the spirit growing within me and to see myself moving into greater and greater fellowship with my God.</p>
  
  <p>There really is a God. There really is a &ldquo;way,&rdquo; The keys of the priesthood must be turned in our individual lives to progress along the path of fellowship with God. Coming to know God (the knowledge of God) really means one thing &mdash; it means to become like him, one with him in the light and truth of the Holy Spirit. As we are sanctified through the keys of the priesthood we come to know him, to understand him, to commune with him and to truly love him. I will talk to you more about the fourth key, as I promised, when you come home.</p>
  
  <p>For now, see your privilege and mission, that you are a &ldquo;true messenger&rdquo; in a dark world with nothing less than the gift of godhood to give to whoever will receive it.</p>
  
  <p>With all my love,<br>
  Dad</p>
